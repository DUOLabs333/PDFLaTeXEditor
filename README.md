## Issues
This was a rush job created for a [hackathon](https://vteenhacks-li-fall-2020-.devpost.com/), so there will be a lot of issues with this thing. So, if you see anything wrong with this, just post an issue, and I'll get around to it soon enough.

## Update (11-25-20):
As of today, I am no longer working on this project, as there is a much better tool that provides this functionality and more. You can learn more about it [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/572357/228668). However, of course, anyone is free to work on this, if they so choose.
